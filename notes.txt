The HWT is a wonderful tool for understanding how a discrete wavelet tranformation works.
It is not desirable in practice because the filters are too short - since each filter is length two,
the HWT decouples the data to create values of the transform. In particular, each value of the transform
is created from a 2 x 2 block from the original input. If there is a large change between say row 6 and row 7,
the HWT will not detect it. The HWT also send integers to irrational numbers and for lossless image compression,
it is crucial that the transform send integers to integers. For these reasons, researchers developed more sophisticated filters.

mean filtering, median filtering,

Wavelets are a more general way to represent and analyze multiresolution images
Wavelets are very useful for image compression as seen in the JPG-2000 standard, along with their application in noise filtering.

Go to ParentThe width and height of image must be Even number and multiply of 2, because the Haar wavelet process sum up pair of
 pixel values and divide them by 2, this proces continue until certain level.
